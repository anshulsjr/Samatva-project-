            <h3>What is postpartum depression?</h3>
            <pre>  
        <b>-></b> Postpartum depression (also called PPD) is a medical condition that many women get after having a baby.

        <b>-></b>It’s strong feelings of sadness, anxiety (worry) and tiredness that last for a long time after giving birth.

        <b>-></b> These feelings can make it hard for you to take care of yourself and your baby. PPD can happen any time after childbirth.
             It often starts within 1 to 3 weeks of having a baby. It needs treatment to get better.

        <b>-></b> PPD is a kind of perinatal depression. This is depression that happens during pregnancy or in the first year after giving birth.

        <b>-></b> PPD is the most common complication for women who have just had a baby. It affects up to 1 in 7 women (about 15 percent).

        <b>-></b> For half of women diagnosed with PPD, it’s their first time to have depression. 
            And they may have had signs and symptoms of depression during pregnancy. 

        <b>-></b> If you have PPD in one pregnancy, you’re likely to have it again in another pregnancy.

        <b>-></b> PPD is not your fault. It doesn’t make you a bad person or a bad mother. If you think you have PPD, tell your health care provider.

<b> 
The postpartum period is a transformative phase that can bring about a range of emotional and physical challenges. 
Many individuals experience postpartum blues, anxiety, or depression during this time. 
It's important to recognize and address these challenges to ensure the well-being of both the parent and the baby.</b>
    
<p><strong>Postpartum Depression and Anxiety:</strong> 
    Postpartum depression and anxiety are common mental health challenges that affect new parents. 
    Symptoms may include persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest, changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.</p>
            
<p><strong>Adjustment to Parenthood:</strong> 
    The transition to parenthood can be overwhelming. New parents often face challenges in adjusting to their new roles, routines, and responsibilities.
    Support and guidance during this adjustment period can make a significant difference.</p>
            
<p><strong>Physical Recovery:</strong>
    Childbirth takes a toll on the body, and the recovery process can be physically demanding. 
    Hormonal changes, healing from delivery, and sleep deprivation can contribute to fatigue and discomfort.</p>
            
<p><strong>Self-Care and Balancing:</strong> 
    Caring for a newborn while also prioritizing self-care can be challenging.
    Many parents struggle with finding time for themselves, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and managing stress.</p>
            
<p><strong>Seeking Support:</strong> 
    If you or a loved one is experiencing challenges during the postpartum period, 
    know that you're not alone. Seeking professional support and guidance can be immensely helpful. </p>
